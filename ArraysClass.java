/*
 Arrays.toString() converts the array into a single string where each element is separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets [ ].

Benefits:
Readable Output: You can easily print arrays in a readable format for debugging or logging purposes.
Concise: It saves you from having to manually loop through the array to print each element.
ex.
int[] newArr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(newArr));
output.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(names));


output.
[Alice, Bob, Charlie]
